<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p> Sleep quality is influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, air pollution, noise levels, and light exposure. By integrating real-time sensor data with historical sleep records, we can uncover patterns that reveal how these external conditions impact sleep duration, efficiency, and disturbances.</p>

<h1>Primary Data Source</h1>
<p> Temperature & Humidity sensor (KY-015), Heartbeat sensor (KY-039)</p>
<h1>Secondary Data Source</h1>

[Sleep Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency)<p> and another </p>[Sleep Environment Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikiye/wearable-tech-sleep-quality/data)
</p>
<h1>API to be Provided to Users</h1>
